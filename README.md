# ðŸ”¥ Body Fat Percentage Predictor

Predict **Body Fat Percentage** from body measurements with a highly accurate Linear Regression model trained on the [Body Fat Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/body-fat-prediction-dataset).  
This project demonstrates **end to end ML workflow**: data analysis, model training, evaluation, and a simple CLI-based prediction app.
